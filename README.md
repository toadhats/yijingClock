# yijingClock
A novel (but impractical) binary clock based on the yijing

There are many binary clocks, but tend to keep things simple. I wanted something a little more needlessly complicated, so I made this.

The minutes are represented by the hexagram in the centre. The hours are represeted by the black/white circles. There are 24 hours in a day.
